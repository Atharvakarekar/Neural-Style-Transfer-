# Neural Style Transfer 
# Neural Style Transfer with Streamlit Frontend
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Neural Style Transfer, a fascinating deep-learning technique that allows you to apply one image's artistic style to another's content. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for the style transfer algorithm and a Streamlit frontend for easy and interactive use.

# Neural Style Transfer Notebook
The Jupyter notebook (style_transfer.ipynb) provides a comprehensive and well-documented implementation of Neural Style Transfer using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It takes a content image and a style image as input and produces a stylized output that combines the content of the former with the artistic style of the latter.

# Features
Utilizes a pre-trained CNN for feature extraction
Implements the Gram matrix for style representation
Allows customization of style transfer parameters
Usage
Open the style_transfer.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Follow the instructions to load your content and style images.
Adjust parameters to control the style transfer process.
Run the notebook cells to generate and visualize the stylized output.
Streamlit Frontend
The Streamlit frontend (app.py) provides a user-friendly interface for applying Neural Style Transfer without the need for coding or Jupyter environments. Users can upload content and style images, adjust parameters, and instantly see the stylized result.

# Features
Streamlit web app for easy and interactive style transfer
Upload content and style images directly from your device
Real-time preview of stylized output
Adjustable parameters for customization
# Usage
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app using the command streamlit run app.py.
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided localhost URL.
Upload your content and style images, customize parameters, and view the stylized result instantly.
# Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Streamlit
Pillow
